                <p>
                  I am passionate about creating products and user interfaces
                  that our users like to use. During my time at Northrop I have
                  been able to work on a variety of applications and all with
                  their own tech stack. From working on applications built on
                  JavaFx and Java to working on web based applications that use
                  JavaScript with a Vue.js framework I have gained a wide breath
                  of experience and have overcome many challenges. I love taking
                  on new challenges and trying new things. Previously I was the
                  Scrum Master for a DevOps team where we were administrators
                  for products such as Atlassian, Jenkins, Nexus, and SonarQube.

              <em>Northrop Grumman Corporation (2017 - Present)</em>
              <br />
              Working on designing and creating software from the ground up that
              meets our customers’ needs using Lean UX practices. Mentoring
              other developer that are coming up to speed with our program.
              Worked on improving the CM/DevOps process by making it more
              streamlined and creating tools to automate some of the manual
              processes. Worked on creating training and test documentation for
              a new system that was being deployed. Deployed the infrastructure
              for several environments and conducted validation testing of the
              product with the customer before it was shipped to site.

            My career goals are to learn more about web site design, software
            development, and the infrastructure used to run it. I want be able
            to have at least a basic understanding of what is takes to develop a
            user friendly website from the ground up. Hopefully I will have the
            knowledge to make an impact in the design a user friendly website to
            building the infrastructure that the software uses to run.
